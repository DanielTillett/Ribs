Skeleton SCSS
=============
> This is my opinionated fork of Skeleton, the original author seems to have disappeared and/or lost interest in the project, and my colleagues and I use this an awful lot.

## Whats different here?
My fork has one significant difference over the original project, that is a full SCSS conversion to make use of more modern technologies and to expose a lot more customisation options quickly and easily.

As time goes by I will gradually extend the available options and build a packaging tool that allows you to select all of your customisations in a graphical way, thinking something along the lines of jQuery themeroller, just a bit more lightweight.

## Installing
Either clone this repository and drop in manually, or install from bower:

```
bower install --save Skeleton-SCSS
```

## Changelog
* Apr 23, 2013 - Skeleton SCSS v1.0 - Additional variable conversions and bower submission.
* Jan 31, 2013 - Completed SCSS conversion of Skeleton 1.2.
